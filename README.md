### Little bit about me ðŸ‘‹
Nothing is better than digging into customers' problems and solving them with modern technology. I am expert in software engineering to create scale and optimised software solutions that matter to focus on delivering key outcomes. To achieve this I quickly adapt new learnings, create a good team and excellent work flow for the software development.

I have enjoyed many executive positions throughout my career in software development, engineering and strategy. My personal and professional experiences have taught me the following:

**I can successfully lead a team and develop:**
- Highly scalable applications
- Secure development environment and applications
- Integrate third party apps
- Extensibility of existing apps
- Improve your existing apps

**Educate, refine and drive myself to be a better person:**
- I am constantly learning, because I never settle
- I stay calm when faced with adversity
- I focus on making high-quality decisions

I enjoy learning new strategies and innovative technology solutions. Love to do self starter research. Reach-out if you want to talk to me about emerging technology, software development, product development, IT securities or history.
